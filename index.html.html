    <h4>
      Vikings<em>[a]</em> is the modern name given to seafaring people
      originally from Scandinavia (<em
        >present-day Denmark, Norway and Sweden</em
      >),<em>[3][4][5][6]</em> who from the late 8th to the late 11th centuries
      raided, pirated, traded and settled throughout parts of Europe.<em
        >[7][8][9]</em
      >
      They also voyaged as far as the Mediterranean, North Africa, Volga
      Bulgaria, the Middle East, and North America. In some of the countries
      they raided and settled in, this period is popularly known as the Viking
      Age, and the term "Viking" also commonly includes the inhabitants of the
      Scandinavian homelands as a collective whole.

    <h4>
      The Vikings had a profound impact on the early medieval history of
      Scandinavia, the British Isles, France, Estonia, and Kievan Rus'.<em
        >[10]</em
      >
      Expert sailors and navigators aboard their characteristic longships,
      Vikings established Norse settlements and governments in the British
      Isles, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, Normandy, and the Baltic
      coast, as well as along the Dnieper and Volga trade routes across
      modern-day Russia, Belarus,<em>[11]</em> and Ukraine,<em>[12]</em> where
      they were also known as Varangians. The Normans, Norse-Gaels, Rus' people,
      Faroese and Icelanders emerged from these Norse colonies. The Vikings also
      voyaged to Constantinople, Iran,<em>[13]</em> and Arabia.

    <h2 style="color:rgb(33, 48, 42)">Vickings And Christianity</h2>
    <h4>
      The Vikings spoke Old Norse and made inscriptions For most of the period
      they followed the Old Norse religion, but later became Christians. The
      Vikings had their own laws, art and architecture. Most Vikings were also
      farmers, fishermen, craftsmen and traders. Popular conceptions of the
      Vikings often strongly differ from the complex, advanced civilisation of
      the Norsemen that emerges from archaeology and historical sources. A
      romanticised picture of Vikings as noble savages began to emerge in the
      18th century; this developed and became widely propagated during the
      19th-century Viking revival.<em>[16][17]</em> Perceived views of the
      Vikings as violent, piratical heathens or as intrepid adventurers owe much
      to conflicting varieties of the modern Viking myth that had taken shape by
      the early 20th century.

    <h4>
      Current popular representations of the Vikings are typically based on
      cultural clichés and stereotypes, complicating modern appreciation of the
      Viking legacy. These representations are rarely accurate—for example,
      there is no evidence that they wore horned helmets, a costume element that
      first appeared in Wagnerian opera.

      <em>[14]</em> They were the first Europeans to reach North America,
      briefly settling in Newfoundland (<em>Vinland</em>). While spreading Norse
      culture to foreign lands, they simultaneously brought home slaves,
      concubines and foreign cultural influences to Scandinavia, influencing the
      genetic<em>[15]</em>
      and historical development of both. During the Viking Age, the Norse
      homelands were gradually consolidated from smaller kingdoms into three
      larger kingdoms: Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
